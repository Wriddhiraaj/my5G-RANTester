## Description

my5G-RANTester is a tool for emulating control and data planes of the UE (user equipment) and gNB (5G base station). my5G-RANTester aims to implement NGAP and NAS protocol definied the 3GPP Release 15 (R15) and beyond. Using my5G-RANTester, it is possible to study several functionalities of a 5G core, including its adherence to the 3GPP standards. Scalability is also a relevant feature of the my5G-RANTester, which is able mimic the behaviour of a large number of UEs accessing a 5G core. Currently, the wireless channel is not implemented in the tool.
